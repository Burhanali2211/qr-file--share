# QR File Sharing

A simple and efficient file-sharing tool that allows users to share files using QR codes. This project generates a QR code for a selected file, which can be scanned to download the file on another device.

## Features
- Generate QR codes for file sharing

## How It Works
1. **Select a file**: Choose the file you want to share.
2. **Generate QR Code**: The application encodes the fileâ€™s download link into a QR code.
3. **Scan the QR Code**: Use any QR code scanner to access the file on another device.
4. **Download the File**: The file is downloaded securely on the receiving device.
